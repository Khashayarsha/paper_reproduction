# paper_reproduction

This is part of the code for my thesis. 

This first part of my thesis aims at repoducing the results from Koopman, Lit (2017)'s paper 
'Forecasting footbal match results in national league competitions using score-driven time series models'.

In this paper, the strengths of football (i.e. soccer) teams are decomposed into attack strengths and defense strengths, 
and are allowed to vary with time according to a score-driven model, which updates at each new time according to the score (first derivative of likelihood function)
of the distribution from which match results are assumed to be drawn (a bivariate-poisson distribution which uses abovementioned attack and defense strengths
as 2 of its paramters).
